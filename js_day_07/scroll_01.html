<h1>scrolling window test</h1>
<p>
    This example shows a scrolling window created using javascript and the W3C DOM. The red-borderd window below is
    actually a layer that shows a clipped portion of larger layer.
</p>
<div id="thewindow">
<div id="thetext">
<p>
    This is the first paragraph of the scrolling message. The message is created with ordinary HTML.
</p>
<p>
    Entries within the scrolling area can use any HTML tags. They can contain <a href="#">Links</a>
</p>
<p>
    There's no limit on the number of paragraphs that you can include here. They don't even need to be formatted as paragraphs.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>For example, you could format items using a bulleted list.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The scrolling ends when the last part of the scrolling text is on the screen. You've reached the end.
